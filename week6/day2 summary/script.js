Mctaba Labs started the session by welcoming the class and noting that the number of attendees was sufficient to begin the lesson immediately. Mctaba Labs stated that the topic for the current session would be covering the rest parameter and how to write an arrow function, following up on the previous day's discussion of default values.
Mctaba Labs outlined the agenda for the session, which included covering rest parameters, spread operators, and how to combine them with default parameters, before being asked by Valary Kirui about the extension used for code autocompletion in the previous day's class, which Mctaba Labs identified as an AI tool. Mctaba Labs then reiterated the importance of default parameters for a fallback when an argument is not provided and introduced rest parameters, which allow a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, before asking if attendees like Benard, who responded negatively, take notes.
Mctaba Labs introduced the topics for the session, which included rest parameters, spread operators, combining rest and default parameters, and arrow functions, concluding that the day's assignment would be creating a calculator utilizing these concepts. Mctaba Labs defined a rest parameter as allowing a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, defined using three dots, and demonstrated the syntax for both a default parameter, which Bernard helped confirm the usage of quotes for, and a rest parameter. Mctaba Labs further emphasized that a rest parameter must always be the last parameter listed in a function, which prompted sheryl Ochieng designs to ask for clarification on what was being written inside the function's brackets.
Mctaba Labs began the discussion by reviewing the definition of a function, which involves the `function` keyword, a name, parentheses for parameters, and curly braces for the code, noting that parameters can be default, normal, or rest parameters, with the latter allowing a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. After confirming that Richard knows how to write arrow functions and sheryl Ochieng designs knows "just a bit," Mctaba Labs decided to focus on rest parameters first and then address arrow function syntax later, subsequently proposing to create a function called `sumAll` that can sum any number of numbers using a rest parameter named `ns`.Mctaba Labs was trying to debug a function intended to sum numbers in an array, initially noting that the function was only returning the original array of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) rather than the total sum, before suggesting the use of the `reduce` method to calculate the total. Benard identified the issue, pointing out that the `console.log` on line 12 was logging the array of numbers first. After commenting out the unnecessary `console.log` following Benard's suggestion, Mctaba Labs further explained that the `sumAll` function was designed to sum any number of array elements using the `reduce` method, which is an array method, to loop through the array and calculate the total sum.
Mctaba Labs demonstrated that line 14 of the code ensures the function works even when called without an array or with an empty array, which results in an output of zero. sheryl Ochieng designs asked Mctaba Labs to explain line 14, specifically what the `reduce` method does, noting that they had not covered the `reduce` method, although they had covered other methods. Mctaba Labs explained that the `reduce` method is typically used for operations like summing an array or grouping data within an array of objects by a specific property, but then paused the technical explanation to ask which string or array methods the participants had actually covered, emphasizing that consistent practice is the key to perfecting knowledge on methods.
Mctaba Labs recommended using the website Code Wars, where users can practice array and string methods in their free time by solving problems like defining a function to remove values from an array, with the ability to test their code and save their completed code (called "gists") to GitHub. Mctaba Labs emphasized the need for self-practice due to the extensive number of array methods, suggesting that users should focus on knowing the major ones and then practicing regularly. Mctaba Labs also explained that they used rest parameters in a function called `sum all` and employed the array method `reduce` to calculate the array's sum, ensuring the calculation starts from zero to avoid errors, even with an empty argument.
Mctaba Labs inquired if there were any questions before moving on to the spread operator, which they defined as a tool that allows copying all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object. Mctaba Labs then proceeded to illustrate the use of the spread operator with an example using arrays, defining two mean arrays, `mean one` and `mean two`, and explaining that a third array, `mean combo`, would carry the array of numbers from the previous two using the spread operator syntax (`dot dot dot min`).
Mctaba Labs demonstrated the use of a spread operator, explaining that it allows for copying all or part of an existing array into another array or object, and showed how it combined two arrays into a single array named `mean combo` with the elements 50, 70, and 99. Sheryl Ochieng designs then asked if it was possible to add only a part of an array rather than the whole thing, to which Mctaba Labs responded yes, explaining that to add only a part of an array or object, it must be combined with other methods such as `slice`, `filter`, or `map`. Mctaba Labs suggested using resources like W3 schools for further understanding and noted that the `slice` method, for example, slices out a piece of an array into a new array.
Mctaba Labs demonstrated how to copy a part of an existing array, emphasizing the necessity of knowing which method to use, whether dealing with an object or an array. Mctaba Labs illustrated this process by using the `slice` method to copy a part of the `min one` array and then concatenating it with the full `min` array. Specifically, Mctaba Labs showed how to slice the first two elements of `min one` to get the values 99 and 28, confirming that this method is a way of copying part of an array and noting that one can also slice the last two or first two elements.
Mctaba Labs demonstrated slicing an array, explaining that for slices zero and two, the first two elements—50 and 70—are omitted, leaving 99 and 28, and they also inquired if the audience, including Nazrian, understood the concept of copying parts of an array using the spread operator, which was confirmed by a thumbs-up from Bernard. Mctaba Labs then shifted the discussion to using the spread operator with objects, starting to define an object named "car" with properties like brand ("Toyota"), model, and color, before proceeding to define another object called "car more" and eventually introducing a "car combo" variable.Mctaba Labs demonstrated the use of the spread operator with objects, specifically showing how it lists the contents of the variables `car` and `camel` into the `car combo` variable. Sheryl Ochieng designs observed that even though there were two models, only "Corolla" was listed in the console, prompting Mctaba Labs to explain that in JavaScript, if two objects have the same property name, the one that comes later overrides the earlier one, which is why the later-defined "Corolla" model was displayed instead of the "Camry" model. Mctaba Labs further demonstrated this by changing the `color` property from red to blue in a later object, confirming that the last-called object's property is the one that is dominant and displayed in the output.
Mctaba Labs checked with Shere to see if they had understood the material and then paused screen sharing to check their progress in the lesson. Mctaba Labs then proposed an alternative method, suggesting they assume they only want a specific property from the current object, and explained that the spread operator would not be used in this scenario. Mctaba Labs demonstrated how to copy all properties and their values—brand, model, and color—from the object "car," and then tried manually adding one property to the object "camel."
Mctaba Labs demonstrated how to add properties from a "car" object to another object manually, resulting in the properties "Toyota Camry" and "red" in the new object. Following this, Mctaba Labs confirmed the understanding of the concept after Mzalendo Daima commented that the group was digesting the information as the session progressed. Mctaba Labs then reiterated that the spread operator enables copying all or part of an existing array into another array or object and suggested doing another example, specifically demonstrating how to find the largest number in a defined array named "columns."
